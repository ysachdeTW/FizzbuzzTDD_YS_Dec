# FizzbuzzTDD
A little Java skeleton application for practicing making Fizzbuzz using Test Driven Development

Best done with a pair!

---

## Program Requirements

1. The Fizzbuzz and Fizzbuzz class are already created.
2. There should be one public method in the Fizzbuzz class that has 1 String for input and 1 String for output.
3. The method should output the String "fizz" if a number divisible by 3 is input.
4. The method should output the String "buzz" if a number divisible by 5 is input.
5. The method should output the String "fizzbuzz" if a number divisible by 3 and 5 is input.
6. The method should output the String "not fizzy or buzzy" if a number not divisible by 3 or 5 is input.
7. The method should output the input string if it is not a number.
8. The method should write any errors to the console log.

## Exercise Requirements
1. Use test-first TDD in a red-green-refactor cycle to write the application.
2. Create a Git commit with each green test and each completed refactor.
3. Switch driver and navigator between each commit if pairing.
